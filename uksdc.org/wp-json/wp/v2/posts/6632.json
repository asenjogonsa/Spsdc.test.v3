All the students had previously won either a regional or video competition and so some of <\/span>the UK\u2019s best and brightest were split into companies and put under pressure to produce a design during two days of competition.<\/p>\n<p>Working in companies of 50, the students combined <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their scientific knowledge, creativity, intuition and research skills to create a design fulfilling an industry style Request For Proposal (RFP). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RFP is a detailed specification set by the judges explaining what they are looking for. At the end of the design time, companies then had to present their proposals to the judges and other companies, \u00a0followed by a gruelling session of questioning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every year, the judges are impressed by the wealth of technological understanding and innovation that students present; ideas that could one day be applied in the UK space industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the winning team of the national competition, 12 will then be invited to represent the UK at the International Space Settlement Design Competition at NASA Kennedy Space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organiser Dr Randall Perry said: \u201cIt&#8217;s been a fantastic weekend of innovation and excellence. We\u2019ve had it all this weekend; from advanced robotics to porta-loo escape pods &#8211; it truly has been a fun weekend. Ultimately, there can only be one winner and the team that did win displayed ideas that not only met the specification, but also were innovative. I wish the 12 that get selected to represent the UK at NASA the best of luck.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The president of the winning company, Jan Apolin, 18, from East Sussex, said: \u201cI kind of don\u2019t believe what\u2019s happening but now I\u2019ve finally won I\u2019m so happy. I\u2019ve been a part of this competition for 2 years and to finally win the national finals is great. It would be an honour to represent the UK and I want to thank all of my team for their hard work. Now I\u2019ve got to go and find my voice! I\u2019ve never screamed with happiness so much!\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The international competition follows a similar format but sees the students working with others from all around the globe for three days to produce an even more detailed design.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information visit <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/uksdc.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uksdc.org<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":17,"featured_media":6005,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[158,47],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.8 -
